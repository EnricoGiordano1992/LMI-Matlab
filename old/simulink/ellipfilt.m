% F = ellipfilt (n, xi, damp, wF)
%
% computes an elliptic-type body bending filter of nth order
% Inputs
%   n     order of the filter
%   xi    (> 1), defines the ripple, large values give small ripple
%             small values > 1, high ripple but a sharp change at wF
%   damp  damping in dB of filter
%   wF   filter cut-off frequency
